# Read Receipts: Reading Life Enhancement Platform
*Project Documentation - Version 1.0 - March 17, 2025*

## Project Overview

Read Receipts is pivoting from a full reading platform to a Reading Life Enhancement Platform that works alongside readers' existing books and reading apps. This approach allows us to work within our technical constraints while providing significant value to our engaged Instagram community of romance/fantasy readers.

### Core Vision
Create tools that enhance readers' existing reading experience rather than trying to replace their primary reading apps, working with books they already own in any format (physical, digital, audio).

### Current Constraints
- Limited to public domain books in original concept
- Primary audience: romance/fantasy readers interested in new releases
- ~750 Instagram followers focused on reading life content

### New Direction
Position Read Receipts as a companion to readers' existing habits rather than a replacement for established reading platforms. Focus on enhancing organization, tracking, community, and discovery while working with any books our users already own.

**Content Examples:**

- Story polls: "What disrupts your reading focus most?" → prioritizing Reading Life Scheduler features

### Phase 2: Direct Feature Inquiry (2-3 months)
- Content explicitly discussing reading life challenges
- "Would you use..." hypothetical feature questions
- Sharing simple mockups of potential interfaces
- Testing willingness to adopt digital reading companions

**Content Examples:**
- Carousel: "Digital Tools for Readers: What's Actually Helpful?"
- Story series: "Dream Reading App Features" polls
- Engagement questions: "What would you want a reading companion app to do first?"

### Phase 3: Early Access Recruitment (3-4 months)
